# CryptoRace (CRYPTORACE)

Create a web application named 'Crypto-Race' on the Base blockchain where users drive virtual race cars through terrains representing various cryptocurrencies. Include features for collecting coins, dodging obstacles that symbolize market volatility, and answering trivia questions to increase speed and repair vehicle damage. Implement a reward system where users can redeem in-game achievements for real cryptocurrency. Ensure the design is intuitive, engaging, and educational, targeting users eager to learn about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
